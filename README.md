# 🔄 Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction Pipeline (SQL, Power BI, Machine Learning)

This end-to-end data analytics project identifies and predicts customer churn using a full data pipeline that combines **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **machine learning (Random Forest)**. The goal is to uncover patterns behind churn behavior, visualize churn drivers, and enable proactive retention strategies through predictive modeling.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Customer data was initially stored in Excel files and imported into a SQL Server database. After cleaning and transforming the data using SQL, it was analyzed and visualized in Power BI to understand churn behavior across several dimensions. A **Random Forest classifier** was then trained to predict churn with **84% accuracy**, helping the business take **preemptive action** before customers leave.
